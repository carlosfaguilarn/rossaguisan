Rocket comes with over 23 hand-crafted pages with a careful attention to the details. Not only that, but there's also a complete UI Kit that comes together with these pages..

Every HTML page is W3C verified, fully responsive and the components and colors contrasts were created in order to comply with the latest WCAG 2.1 standards.

The backbone of Rocket is the most widely used CSS Framework in the world, namely Bootstrap. We also made sure to use the latest stable version available.
