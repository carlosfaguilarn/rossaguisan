## Color scheme

We have already carefully selected the optimal color scheme for Pixel, but your business may need another color palette. Here's how you can change the colors using Sass.

Go to the `scss/pixel/_variables.scss` file and search for the following variables:

{{< highlight sass >}}
$primary: #0648B3;
$secondary: #EE5050;
$tertiary: #05A677;
{{< /highlight >}}

Change the hex color for each variable to the color palette that you desire.
